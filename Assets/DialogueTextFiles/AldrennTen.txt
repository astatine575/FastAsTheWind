 You again? What do you want?/3
I was just wondering if you could make me some warded weapons./1/-1
Is something wrong?/2/-1
No particular reason. Just curious, is all. Sorry to bother you. *LEAVE*/7/0
 Nope. Don't do that anymore. Goodbye./3
What? Why not?/2/-1
I'm afraid you don't have a choice, bud. *THREATEN*/6/2
Oh. Alright then. *LEAVE*/7/1
 (He frowns silently for a while, as though considering his response. Then he sighs, and his expression softens.)/1

 Aah, fine, I might as well tell you. You may even be able to help. You see, last week my daughter ran off with this ragtag group of sailors, sailing on a vessel by the name of "Relentless". Dockworkers told me they weren't flyin' no colors, so I'm afraid they were pirates./2
If I brought her back to you, would you make warded weapons for me?/4/-1
Ah. I see. Sorry to have bothered you. *LEAVE*/7/3
 You would do that for me? I mean, yes, of course I'd make you weapons, if you did something like that. Why, if you bring her back safely, I'll make you some weapons for free!/2
It's a deal then. I bring you your daughter, you make warded weapons for me./5/4
On second thought, that all seems like too much trouble. You'll have to find her on your own. *LEAVE*/7/3
 You have made me a happy man, good sirs! I must warn you, however: My daughter is a little. . . wrong in the head, if you know what I mean. Has delusions, and the like. I'd recommend taking anything she tells you with a grain of salt./2
I'll keep that in mind, thanks. *LEAVE*/7/-1
Uh. . . right. . . *LEAVE*/7/-1
 (The man laughs, then slams the door in your face. Etchings in the building's wooden surfaces begin to glow, and the house is surrounded by a magical aura. Even an army would be hard-pressed to get at the man now./1
