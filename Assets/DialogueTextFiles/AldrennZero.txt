 (The building where this "blackwardsmith" supposedly lives sits at the corner of a thinly populated street, its shutters drawn shut. No one seems to be going in or out, and there's no smoke coming from the chimney)/2

 (There's a long period of silence. Then, there's the sound of someone walking towards the door, growing louder. A heavy latch is undone from the other side, and the door swings open.)/1

 (Standing there with arms folded, his brow creased in irritation, is a man of middling age who looks like he hasn't shaved—or bathed—for days.)/1
*CONTINUE*/3/-1
 Hmmph. What is it?/4
Sorry, but are you Aldrenn Morr? The blackwardsmith?/4/-1
I want some warded weapons, and you're going to make them for me. *THREATEN*/10/2
What's wrong with you?/6/-1
Ah, um. . . nothing. Sorry to bother you, sir! *LEAVE*/11/0
 Yeah. That's me. What of it?/3
I was just wondering if you could make me some warded weapons./5/-1
Is something wrong?/6/-1
No particular reason. Just curious, is all. Sorry to bother you. *LEAVE*/11/0
 Nope. Don't do that anymore. Goodbye./3
What? Why not?/6/-1
I'm afraid you don't have a choice, bud. *THREATEN*/10/2
Oh. Alright then. *LEAVE*/11/1
 (He frowns silently for a while, as though considering his response. Then he sighs, and his expression softens.)/1
*CONTINUE*/7/-1
 Aah, fine, I might as well tell you. You may even be able to help. You see, last week my daughter ran off with this ragtag group of sailors, sailing on a vessel by the name of "Relentless". Dockworkers told me they weren't flyin' no colors, so I'm afraid they were pirates./2
If I brought her back to you, would you make warded weapons for me?/8/-1
Ah. I see. Sorry to have bothered you. *LEAVE*/11/3
 You would do that for me? I mean, yes, of course I'd make you weapons, if you did something like that. Why, if you bring her back safely, I'll make you some weapons for free!/2
It's a deal then. I bring you your daughter, you make warded weapons for me./9/4
On second thought, that all seems like too much trouble. You'll have to find her on your own. *LEAVE*/11/3
 You have made me a happy man, good sirs! I must warn you, however: My daughter is a little. . . wrong in the head, if you know what I mean. Has delusions, and the like. I'd recommend taking anything she tells you with a grain of salt./2
I'll keep that in mind, thanks. *LEAVE*/11/-1
Uh. . . right. . . *LEAVE*/11/-1
 (The man laughs, then slams the door in your face. Etchings in the building's wooden surfaces begin to glow, and the house is surrounded by a magical aura. Even an army would be hard-pressed to get at the man now./1
